# Privacy Policy — Warranti: Home Inventory & Receipt Manager

Effective date: January 1, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Warranti (“the App”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information. Warranti is designed to organize warranties, receipts, and home inventory with privacy in mind. Attachments (images/PDFs) are stored on your device and are not uploaded to our servers.

## Overview

- On‑device attachments: Receipt photos/PDFs are saved locally on your device.
- Cloud data: Account and inventory metadata are stored in Firebase (Authentication + Firestore).
- Ads: Google AdMob may collect device identifiers for ad delivery and measurement.
- Notifications: The App schedules local reminders if you enable them.

## Information We Collect

**Account Information:**

- Email address and optional display name (via Firebase Authentication).

**Inventory Metadata:**

- Item name, category, purchase date, warranty length, expiry date, price.
- Attachment references: Local file paths for images/PDFs (attachments themselves are stored on device).

**Device & Usage:**

- Basic device info (OS version, app version) for troubleshooting.
- Minimal in‑app state needed to provide features (e.g., notification lead time).

We do not collect sensitive categories such as financial account numbers, government IDs, health data, or precise location.

## How We Use Information

- Provide core features (inventory tracking, warranty countdowns, receipts reference, reminders).
- Authenticate users and securely associate inventory with your account.
- Generate reports you choose to export/share.
- Display ads to keep the App free, where supported.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal information.
We may share limited data with service providers strictly to operate the App:

- **Firebase Authentication & Firestore (Google):** Account and inventory metadata storage.
- **Google AdMob:** Ad delivery, measurement, and fraud prevention.
- **Expo Notifications:** Local scheduling APIs on device; no centralized push used.

Data may also be disclosed to comply with law, protect rights, or enforce terms.

## Data Retention

- Account & inventory metadata: Retained while your account is active. Deleted upon account deletion.
- Attachments on device: You control retention; delete them from item details or uninstall the App.
- Logs/diagnostics (if any): Retained for a limited period for troubleshooting.

## Security

- Data in transit is protected by HTTPS when communicating with Firebase.
- Attachments remain on device storage; use your device’s security features (PIN/biometrics).
- We regularly update dependencies and follow best practices; no system is 100% secure.

## Your Rights

Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data.

- In‑App: Use Settings → Account → Delete account to remove your account.
- Receipts/images: Remove per item in product details.
- You can also contact us to request assistance.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13 (or as defined by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Permissions Used

- **CAMERA:** Capture receipt photos.
- **READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:** Import and display attachments.
- **POST_NOTIFICATIONS:** Schedule warranty reminders you opt into.

## International Transfers

Data processed by Firebase and AdMob may be transferred to and stored on servers outside your country, subject to applicable laws and standard safeguards.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The “Effective date” will reflect the latest version. Continued use of the App means you accept the updated policy.
